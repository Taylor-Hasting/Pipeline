# Pipeline
Simple scripts I've created to help me interface with a pipeline and data infrastructure.
These are bits and pieces of a pipeline idea i've had in my head for a while but am too lazy or dumb to make into a complete package. 

The eventual goal is a simple tool to help identify outliers in a given list then do something with these outliers.
